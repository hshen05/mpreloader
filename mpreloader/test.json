S&P gave Amazon's debt an AA-. That's not much different a rating than that of the U.S. government, which, despite the country's recent fiscal problems, is still considered sterling credit and gets an AA+. \"We think Amazon has a very low probability of default,\" says David Kuntz, S&P's analyst who rated the bond."},{"type":"paragraph","value":"On the same day, Moody's came out with its rating for Amazon's debt: Nearly junk. The actual rating was Baa1, which is the equivalent of BBB+ and only two steps up from the demarcation line between what is considered a safe investment and what's not."},{"type":"paragraph","value":"MORE: What will Amazon do with $3 billion in free money?"},{"type":"paragraph","value":"While the ratings agencies do sometimes give different ratings to the same bond deal, it's very rare for them to diverge as widely as they have on Amazon. David Novosel, a senior analyst at independent bond research house Gimme Credit, says a four notch difference, which is the spread between S&P's rating and Moody's, is \"almost unheard of.\""},{"type":"paragraph","value":"Another way to think about it is the different between China and Italy. China, which is growing its GDP at more than 7%, gets an AA- rating from S&P. Italy, on the other hand, was seen last year to be on the verge of a sovereign debt crisis. It gets a rating of BBB+."},{"type":"paragraph","value":"About a year ago, S&P's former chief credit officer Mark Adelson, who left the agency in August after pushing for stricter ratings criteria, says he went through the ratings of the 125 companies in the CDX North American Investment Grade index. He says he found little difference between S&P and Moody's on any of the companies. \"Splits happen,\" says Adelson. \"But a four notch difference is quite big.\""},{"type":"paragraph","value":"Even stranger is that the split is on Amazon, a company that has relatively little debt and is these days beloved by stock investors. Shares of Amazon (AMZN) are up more than 45% this year to a recent $253."},{"type":"paragraph","value":"MORE: Jeff Bezos: 2012 Business Person of the Year"},{"type":"paragraph","value":"Moody's (MCO), the more bearish of the two, focused on the fact that Amazon recently reported its lowest level of profits in six years. The analysts said profit margins were likely to stay down, due to rising competition and increased shipping costs. In addition, Moody's analysts said they thought the company's push into devices and other online services will require more capital spending, which would also drag down profits."},{"type":"paragraph","value":"S&P, on the other hand, said Amazon was dominating online, and would continue to do so. Even with the addition of sales taxes, which have not been charged online in many states, S&P's Kuntz said he thought the company's revenue could continue to grow more than 30% a year for the next few years. Despite its profit problems, Kuntz thought Amazon had about double the amount of cash on hand than it needed to make its interest payments."},{"type":"paragraph","value":"Kuntz declined to comment on Moody's rating. Moody's didn't return calls for comment on its bond rating for Amazone or why it differed from S&P's."},{"type":"paragraph","value":"MORE:�The best of everything in tech this year"},{"type":"paragraph","value":"Adelson says the different rating is not likely the result of a conflict of interest or some other behind the scenes deal. Amazon probably paid Moody's and S&P the same fee to rate its bonds. And Amazon is not a big issuer of debt so there was no real reason for either company to try to woo Amazon to use it again."},{"type":"paragraph","value":"In fact, Adelson says the difference of opinion is a good sign. During the financial crisis, the ratings agencies were often criticized as being rubber stamps for Wall Street, giving top ratings to tens of billions in mortgage deals that eventually had to be downgraded. The Securities and Exchange Commission is reportedly still examining the process by which the agencies rated mortgage bonds at the height of the housing bubble."},{"type":"paragraph","value":"So who's right on Amazon bonds? S&P or Moody's? Potentially neither. Amazon's 10-year bonds, which were offered with a yield of 2.5%, now have a yield of 2.64%, which means they have lost value. Nonetheless, Gimme Credit's Novosel says if the market really viewed the bonds as BBB+, the yield would have dropped to 3%. But they're not quite a AA-, either. Bonds with that rating tend to trade for a yield of 2.3%. So Amazon probably should have a rating somewhere between the ratings of S&P and Moody's, which is probably how the system is supposed to work."}],"desktopLink":"http://finance.fortune.cnn.com/2012/12/18/amazon-bond-fight/","section":"TermSheet","link":"http://money.cnn.com/mobile/json/2012/12/18/amazon_bond_fight.json"}]},"http://money.cnn.com/mobile/json/2012/12/18/ira_real_estate.json" :{"items":[{"id":"2012_12_18_ira_real_estate_","contenttype":"blogArticle","title":"Real estate in your IRA?

And an increasing number of affluent savers have been using their retirement accounts to purchase homes, rental apartments, and other properties. Done properly, such a strategy can generate good income with modest volatility. But before you dive in, take heed: It's a time-consuming proposition, and you'll need to proceed carefully not just to avoid investment losses but also to stay clear of some nasty tax pitfalls."},{"type":"paragraph","value":"To buy real estate within a retirement account, you first need to set up a \"self-directed\" IRA with a custodian. Once you've established the IRA, you can then use it to purchase practically any type of real estate, including vacant land, single- and multi-family homes, commercial properties, co-ops, and condos. But you'll also have to adhere to a slew of IRS regulations."},{"type":"paragraph","value":"MORE:�15 top stock picks from star investors"},{"type":"paragraph","value":"For starters, \"you can't use real estate in a self-directed IRA for your personal benefit,\" says Richard Price, a CPA with Houston-based Cornelius Stegent & Price. If you do, the IRS could disqualify the IRA, in which case you'd owe ordinary income taxes on the entire value of the property, plus a 10% penalty. For instance, you could buy a Miami condo and rent it to third parties, but you couldn't stay even one night there yourself. Nor could you rent it out or grant free use of it to most close relatives. You couldn't renovate or actively manage the property yourself. You're also prohibited from buying real estate for the IRA that you or selected family members already own."},{"type":"paragraph","value":"To prevent the IRA from being disqualified, all income generated by the real estate must be paid directly into the IRA and remain there until you retire. If you sell the property, all proceeds must likewise stay in the IRA. Expenses, such as property taxes, insurance, and improvements, must come straight from the IRA; you can't use personal funds to pay for them, and you can't deduct them for tax purposes. You'll therefore need to leave enough cash inside the IRA to keep the property running (for 2013, you can contribute up to $5,500 to your self-directed IRA, or $6,500 if you're age 50 or older)."},{"type":"paragraph","value":"MORE:�Wall Street experts - where to make money in 2013"},{"type":"paragraph","value":"If you sell real estate within a regular self-directed IRA, any appreciation on the property will ultimately get taxed as ordinary income when you take withdrawals, at rates currently up to 35%. But if you set up a self-directed Roth IRA (in which your contributions are made with after-tax dollars), all your property gains and withdrawals will be tax-free. That's assuming, of course, that you have gains. There's no guarantee that the real estate market won't tank again.

An executive might provide inside information to an analyst or just a group of analysts, letting them in on what the quarter would look like for their company. The Wall-Streeters in the know might then \"trade on it in proprietary terms or their clients would trade. It set up all of the reprehensible aspects of insider trading,\" Goldschmid told me. While the executive might not pocket any money, he might be buying goodwill or ingratiating himself to his followers."},{"type":"paragraph","value":"So the question was how to get at these cases of an executive leaking to favored groups, which were more difficult to handle than a standard tip with a payoff. \"There was an argument whether we could do it on the insider trading law,\" Goldschmid said. \"And as I became general counsel, there were about 14 cases that had been collected that we could bring to try to broaden out insider trading law to reach this kind of activity by corporations.\""},{"type":"paragraph","value":"Some of Goldschmid's academic colleagues thought the SEC might not be able to prevail in those cases. �He said his deputy thought the chance of winning would be like \"shooting fish in a barrel.\" There were also concerns that bringing the cases under the insider trading law could create confusion and that the draconian penalties of insider trading might be too severe."},{"type":"paragraph","value":"Regulation FD was the solution to stop this selective disclosure of information and give everyone a heads up in advance that there were new rules and what the parameters would be. At its core, Regulation FD was designed to stop insider trading where it begins, with inside information -- and to create markets that are fair so that people without special access would want to invest."},{"type":"paragraph","value":"MORE:�Lessons from a reluctant manager"},{"type":"paragraph","value":"Contrary to what the New York Times' Steven Davidoff argues, Reg FD has nothing to do with \"the S.E.C.'s fetish of trying to control company disclosure to the nth degree.\" In fact, Regulation FD is there to safeguard our markets and ensure taxpayer dollars aren't squandered any more than need be. FD performs this simply too, by stopping insider trading in its tracks."},{"type":"paragraph","value":"I caught up with Goldschmid this week and he put it well. \"There is no question from any serious empirical studies that there is more information out today, available to the public, than ever before. We see companies using open phone calls allowing investors and others on the lines and avoiding the kind of underhanded disclosure of information that existed in the past. Regulation FD is what our country needs. We need fair markets and we need to avoid the large advantage of the favored few.\""},{"type":"paragraph","value":"Eleanor Bloxham is CEO of The Value Alliance and Corporate Governance Alliance (http://thevaluealliance.com), a board advisory firm."}],"desktopLink":"http://management.fortune.cnn.com/2012/12/17/why-netflix-got-into-hot-water/","section":"FortuneManagement","link":"http://money.cnn.com/mobile/json/2012/12/17/why_netflix_got_into_hot_water.json"}]}}
